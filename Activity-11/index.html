          Bread is a baked food product made from water, flour, and yeast and 
          is a staple food across the world particularly in Europe and the Middle East. 
          Throughout recorded history and around the world, it has been an important part 
          of many cultures' diets. It is one of the oldest human-made foods, having been of 
          significance since the dawn of agriculture, and plays an essential role in both 
          religious rituals and secular culture.
          Bread may be leavened by naturally occurring icrobes (e.g. sourdough), chemicals (e.g. baking soda), industrially produced yeast,
          or high-pressure aeration, which creates the gas bubbles that fluff up bread. Bread 
          may also be unleavened. In many countries, mass-produced bread often contains 
          additives to improve flavor, texture, color, shelf life, nutrition, and ease of production.
