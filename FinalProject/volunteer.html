                    <h2>Volunteer Experience</h2>
                    <P>
                        I served as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in England for 18 months. My assignment 
                        included giving tours of a chapel in London and serving in the teaching center. At the teaching center, we received 
                        requests from people around the world who wanted to attend church in their local areas. We helped them connect with 
                        missionaries near them and taught them about our beliefs over the phone. Talking to people from many different 
                        countries and serving with missionaries from diverse backgrounds helped me develop strong communication skills and 
                        taught me how to work in unity with others. It was a valuable experience that pushed me out of my comfort zone and 
                        helped me grow both in my strengths and weaknesses.
                    </P>
