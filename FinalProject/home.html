                        I'm currently in my second year at Brigham Young University-Hawaii, majoring in 
                        Computer Science and minoring in Music and Social Work. I was born and raised in Nagoya, Japan. 
                        Since a young age, I have been eager to explore different cultures and improve my English skills. 
                        This motivation led me to pursue studying abroad to gain experiences and perspectives that I could not 
                        obtain in Japan. 
                    </P>

                    <p>
                        Music has always been my passion. I began learning music and playing the Electone—a type 
                        of electronic keyboard—at Yamaha Music School when I was 2 years old. I started playing the bass at the 
                        age of 11 and joined the wind orchestra club in both junior high and high school, where I played the 
                        double bass. In 2020, I was awarded the gold prize in Doublebass Competition for Young Amateur Players in 
                        Japan. Currently, I continue to play both the double bass and electric bass in the orchestra at BYUH.
                        I'm passionate about supporting musicians, music educators, and anyone who enjoys music or plays an instrument 
                        by creating software that helps them practice more efficiently and enrich their musical experience.
