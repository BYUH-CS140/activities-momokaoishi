           <q>You are called to serve in <strong>the England London Mission</strong>. Your assignment

            My life in London as a missionary was the best thing ever. Needless to say, being a missionary
            is awesome, but a beutiful city, <em>London</em>, made it even more special.

            <mark>The Hyde Park Chapel Visitor's Centre</mark> is on the Exhibition Road where people from 
            all around the world come visit museums.  The Hyde Park Chapel Visitor's Centre is <small>tiny</small>
             because it's the only visitor's centre that is in a chapel where we have the services on sundays, but it is
             a beutiful chapel with a huge organ.

            There are a lot places to visit in London. The best thing to do in London is to walk along 
            <b>the Thames</b>. Big Ben, St. Paul Cathedral, London Bridge, London Eye... Everything 
            you want to see is found there.

            London is the most diverse city I have ever seen. Everyone comes to London to work, study, 
            travel, and serve God.
